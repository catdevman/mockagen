# Mockagen
Generate massive amounts of local data blazingly fast.

## Compatability
My goal is to make it compatable with Mockaroo's schema format.  It does
not currently have all the same functionality.

## Install
- `git clone https://github.com/catdevman/mockagen`
- `make` (in the root of the directory)
- `mv mockagen <somewhere_in_your_path>`

## Usage
`mockagen -config <config_file_path>`

You can look at `test_data` directory for example configuration files
